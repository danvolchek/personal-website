</ol>
<p>This Contract contains all the terms of agreement between you and Carrier. The acceptance and/or use of this Contract by the person named hereon as Guests shall be deemed to be an acceptance and agreement by each of them of all of the terms and conditions herein. The person purchasing, accepting and/or named on the Contract represents that he/she is authorized by all named Guests, including any minor, to accept and agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of the Contract. This Contract is not transferable and you may not sell or assign it. It is valid only on the Yacht and for the voyage indicated. This contract may not be modified except in writing signed by Carrier. The terms, conditions and limitations herein shall apply to any and all disputes between you and Carrier regardless whether arising aboard the Yacht or in any other place, location or mode of transportation whatsoever. All rights, defenses, disclaimers and limitations of liability set forth herein shall inure to the benefit of the Carrier and all concessionaires, independent contractors or other providers of any services or facilities in connection with or incident to the Guest’s voyage, as well as any of their affiliated or related companies, parents, subsidiaries, successors, assigns or fictitiously named entities; and all suppliers, shipbuilders, component part manufacturers; and their owners, operators, managers, charterers, agents, pilots, officers, crew, employees and vessels.</p>

<li>DEFINITIONS</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>“Carrier” means and includes the owner, Dan Volchek Yacht Holdings, a Norweigan corporation; the Operator, Dan Volchek Yacht Holdings Limited, a Bahamian registered corporation; the named Yacht; and its or their affiliates, officers, directors, management, employees, agents, charterers and tenders.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“You, Your, Guest” means the person(s) purchasing, accepting or using this Contract or who board(s) the Yacht or those in their care, and includes and binds their heirs, successors in interest and personal representatives. Throughout this Contract, use of the singular includes the plural and use of the masculine includes the feminine.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“Voyage” means the sailing from the port of departure to the final port of disembarkation, including any rail, road or sea port, any land accommodation components or package sold with, or included in the price of or taken in connection with the Voyage, any shore excursions or shore side facilities related to or offered during the Voyage, and all transportation to or from the voyage if purchased through or arranged by Carrier.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>“Voyage Fare” means the amount actually received by the Carrier for your voyage. It covers the Voyage package, optional use and enjoyment of Carrier-furnished sports and recreational equipment, scheduled meals and accommodations while on board, air supplements if arranged through Carrier and, if you are participating in any pre-embarkation program, transfers to and from the yacht. Voyage fare does not include Government taxes and fees imposed or sanctioned by any Government, foreign or domestic. These charges are in addition to the Voyage Fare and may include but are not limited to Guest Facility Charges, Security Surcharges, Fuel Surcharges, International Guest Departure or Arrival Tax, Customs User Fee, Immigration Fee and Agricultural Inspection Fee. Voyage fare does not include shipboard services or amenities for which an additional charge is imposed, medical care, shore excursions, optional travel or baggage insurance, or pre or post-voyage hotel expenses and meals not purchased through Carrier as part of your voyage package. The Voyage Fare has been determined far in advance of the voyage departure date on the basis of then existing projections of fuel and other costs. In the event of an increase in fuel or other costs above amounts projected, Carrier has the right to increase the fare at any time up to the voyage departure date and to require payment of the additional fare prior to voyage departure. Carrier has the right to refuse to transport you unless the additional fare is paid. Within seven (7) days after you are notified of the additional fare (but no later than the voyage departure date), you may elect to surrender this contract to us for cancellation, whereupon you will receive a full refund of the voyage fare only. Cancellation fees do not apply to this type of refund.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>TRAVEL AGENTS</li>
</ol>
<p>Any travel agent utilized by Guest in connection with the issuance of this ticket or otherwise making arrangements for air transportation, shore excursions, tours, land, air, or local water transportation or shoreside accommodations and meals, provides such services solely for you, and not for Carrier, as an independent contractor. Carrier accepts no responsibility for any representations, acts, omissions, the financial condition or integrity of any travel agent utilized by Guest in connection with your voyage, including any failure to remit your funds to Carrier or to remit any refund to you, and the guest remains liable for the fare due to the Carrier. Receipt of this Contract or any other documents or information by your travel agent constitutes receipt by you.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>GUEST RESPONSIBILITIES &amp; REPRESENTATIONS</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>GENERAL</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Guests are responsible to comply with any government travel requirements and must have in their possession proof of citizenship in the form of a valid passport, exit and entry visas as required, and any other necessary documentation required by either the United States or any foreign port visited. Guests are advised to consult with their travel agents and the appropriate governmental agencies and embassies to determine applicable requirements. Carrier assumes no responsibility for advising Guests of immigration requirements, may refuse to embark Guest or may disembark Guest in the event Guest does not present required documentation, and shall have no liability whatsoever for a refund or otherwise in such circumstances.</li>
<li>Guest represents and warrants that the Guest is fit to travel and that the Guest’s conduct or presence will not impair the safety of the Yacht or anyone carried on board, or inconvenience, annoy, embarrass or harass any other person. You must, at the time you book your voyage, inform the Carrier, in writing, of any existing physical or mental illness, disability or pregnancy or any other condition for which you or any other person in your care may require medical attention or special accommodation during the voyage and any additional information regarding any prescriptions that may affect you while on the voyage. If any such condition arises after you have booked the voyage, you must report the condition to the Carrier, in writing, as soon as you become aware of it. Pregnant Guests who have entered their 24th week of pregnancy prior to the commencement or during the voyage will not be permitted to embark. Failure to report any such condition or prescriptions will release the Carrier, the Yacht’s doctor, and any other personnel affiliated with the Carrier in any way from any liability related to the accommodation or treatment of such condition. By acceptance of this Contract, Guest acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall have no responsibility or obligation to provide any special services or medical equipment to Guests. The Guest shall be liable to the Carrier and shall reimburse it for all loss, damage or delay sustained by the Carrier because of any omission of the Guest.</li>
<li>Guest warrants that the Guest’s conduct or presence will not impair the safety of any passenger, crew member or the Yacht from over-consumption of alcohol or drugs. Guest further warrants that the Guest will not bother or harass any other passenger or crew member onboard the Yacht with any inappropriate behavior or violate the privacy of any other passenger or crew member by including them in photographs or recordings without their express consent.</li>
<li>The Carrier may refuse to embark, disembark or confine you to a stateroom, if, in the sole opinion of the Carrier, your physical or mental condition creates an unreasonable risk to yourself or others or unreasonably interferes with the peace and tranquility of the Yacht or enjoyment of others. If the Carrier refuses to allow you on board for any of these reasons prior to the commencement of the voyage, a refund of the voyage fare will be treated as a cancellation by the Guest, and a refund, if any, shall be based on the timing of such refusal in accordance with Carrier’s cancellation policy referenced in section 6 of this Contract, with no further liability whatsoever. Carrier recommends that Guests who are not self-sufficient travel with a companion who shall take responsibility for any assistance needed during the voyage and in case of an emergency. Should the Yacht deviate from its course for any cause resulting from the Guest’s negligence or due to a medical emergency involving the Guest, said Guest shall be liable for the related costs incurred and shall indemnify Carrier for any costs, penalties or demands arising therefrom.</li>
<li>No animals will be allowed on the Yacht under any circumstances unless deemed necessary to assist with a physical disability and provided (a) the Carrier is given advance notice at the time of booking the voyage that said animal will be carried aboard; (b) the Guest assumes all responsibility for said animal’s food and hygiene; and (c) the Guest agrees to indemnify and defend Carrier should the assistance animal cause injury, death, damage or loss to any other person or to the Yacht. Guests using assistance animals should check in advance with governmental authorities in each port to be visited to determine local rules, regulations, fees and quarantines applicable to such animals and Carrier shall have no liability to Guest whatsoever arising therefrom.</li>
<li>All guests are strongly advised to consult with their travel agent about the purchase of travel insurance to cover losses of the guest that may be covered by such insurance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>GUEST’S INTERRUPTION OF VOYAGE; QUARANTINE</li>
</ul>
<p>The Carrier may confine you to your stateroom, change your accommodations or disembark or remove you at any port if, in the sole opinion of the Carrier, your presence might be detrimental to your own health, comfort or safety or that of any other persons, you might be excluded from landing at any destination by governmental authorities, or if you violate any provision of this Contract. If you are disembarked for any such reasons, you will not be entitled to any refund or damages. If you are delayed or detained on board the Yacht or elsewhere due to injury, illness, disability or quarantine or due to action of any government or authority or for any other reason, you will be solely responsible for all resulting costs and expenses, including repatriation, and must reimburse the Carrier for any such costs or expenses which it may incur on your behalf.</p>
<ul>
<li>RULES AND REGULATIONS; COMPLIANCE WITH LAW</li>
</ul>
<p>You must at all times obey all the rules, regulations and orders of the Carrier and the Yacht’s Master and officers. You may not solicit other Guests for commercial purposes or advertise goods or services on board the Yacht without the Carrier’s prior written permission. It is your responsibility to comply without delay with the requirements of all immigration, port, health, customs, and government police authorities, and all other laws and regulations of each country or state from or to which you will travel. You must reimburse the Carrier for any charges, costs or resulting expenses or fines that it may incur as a result of your actions or presence on the Yacht, apart from the services provided as part of this Contract.</p>
<ul>
<li>UNAUTHORIZED STOPOVERS OR DISEMBARKATION</li>
</ul>
<p>Unauthorized stopovers or disembarkations, or your failure to make any sailing of the Yacht at any port for any reason shall be at your sole risk and expense. The Carrier shall not be liable in any way for such actions and you will not be entitled to any refund or other compensation under these circumstances, or if you disembark early for any reason.</p>
<p>(E) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PREGNANCY</p>
<p>Guest represents and warrants that the Guest is fit to travel and that the Guest’s conduct or presence will not impair the safety of the Yacht or anyone carried on board, or inconvenience, annoy, embarrass or harass any other person. You must, at the time you book your voyage, inform the Carrier, in writing, of any existing physical or mental illness, disability or pregnancy or any other condition for which you or any other person in your care may require medical attention or special accommodation during the voyage. If any such condition arises after you have booked the voyage, you must report the condition to the Carrier, in writing, as soon as you become aware of it. Pregnant Guests who have entered their 24th week of pregnancy prior to the commencement or during the voyage will not be permitted to embark. Failure to report any such condition will release the Carrier, the Yacht’s doctor, and any other personnel affiliated with the Carrier in any way from any liability related to the accommodation or treatment of such condition. By acceptance of this Contract, Guest acknowledges and agrees that Carrier shall have no responsibility or obligation to provide any special services or medical equipment to Guests. The Guest shall be liable to the Carrier and shall reimburse it for all loss, damage or delay sustained by the Carrier because of any omission of the Guest.</p>

Payment shall be made upon demand and prior to disembarkation.</p>
<p>You accept and use medicine, medical treatment and any other services made available on the Yacht or elsewhere during the voyage at your sole risk and expense without liability or responsibility of the Carrier. Doctors and nurses who may work on board the vessel or ashore, or other medical and service personnel are independent contractors. These individuals work directly for the Guest and shall not be considered to be acting under the control or supervision of the Carrier, since the Carrier is not a medical provider. Guest shall disclose any pre-existing medical conditions and prescriptions to the Doctor onboard prior to any treatment and to the Carrier prior to the disbursement of any motion sickness medications.</p>
<p>Similarly, Carrier does not supervise or control the actions of connecting land and sea carriers, shore excursion or tour operators, doctors, nurses and providers of any other personal services in connection with the voyage, who shall be considered independent contractors working directly for the Guest. Carrier makes no express or implied representations as to the suitability of any such service providers or their facilities, does not guarantee their performance, and in no event shall be liable for any negligent or intentional acts or omissions, loss, damage, injury, death, expense or delay in connection with such services. Guests agree to use all such services at their sole risk. The Guest agrees to indemnify Carrier in the event Carrier elects to pay the cost of all emergency medical care, including transportation connected therewith.</p>
<ul>
<li>EXCLUDED LOSSES</li>

The Guest agrees that any/all such risks are contemplated as forming part of the proposed voyage and this Contract. Carrier shall in no event be liable to the Guest in respect of occurrences taking place off the Yacht or property or launches owned or operated by Carrier. The Yacht’s Master may, in his sole discretion, proceed with or without pilots, assist other mariners or Yachts, or take any other action he in his sole discretion deems necessary or appropriate for the safety of the Yacht or any persons on board, or to assist in any emergency, including but not limited to changes in itineraries or routes. In such event, Guest agrees such actions form part of the agreed conditions of this Contract and Carrier shall have no liability to Guest whatsoever for a refund or otherwise. If you use the Yacht’s athletic or recreational equipment or take part in organized activities, whether on the Yacht or as part of a shore excursion, you hereby agree to assume the risks of injury, death, illness or other loss, for which the Carrier is not responsible.</p>

You must comply with any regulations, tariffs, terms or conditions of any airline or other transportation provider which may include a lower weight limit for baggage. You may not take on board firearms, controlled or prohibited substances or inflammable or hazardous items, or any items prohibited by local, state or national law.

You agree that the carrier’s liability for loss or damage to baggage or personal property is limited under all circumstances to U.S. $250.00 per Guest unless at least 3 weeks prior to embarkation the Guest declares in writing a higher value (in which event the higher value so declared up to a maximum of $2,500.00 shall be the limit of the Carriers liability), and the Guest pays to the Carrier at least three weeks in advance of embarkation the full cost of insurance for such declared values. In such event, Carrier’s liability shall be fully discharged by the procurement of insurance that is subject to any applicable terms, conditions, exclusions and deductible. The Carrier does not undertake to carry as baggage any money, valuables, precious stones, gold, silver or any&nbsp;other similar articles. You should arrange to have them shipped to your destination by other means. Carrier shall not be liable whatsoever, for negligence for otherwise, for any loss or damage to such items, or cash, negotiable instruments, documents, jewelry, computers, electronics, tools of the trade or product samples, dental or optical items of any kind, medications, sports equipment or cameras, whether kept in the cabin, in the Guest’s baggage, in the Yacht’s safe or security boxes or otherwise; or for loss or damage to property or baggage while not in the possession of Carrier on board the Yacht; or for damage due to wear, tear or normal usage. Items stored in the Yacht’s safety deposit boxes are subject to the same limitations as set forth above.

The value of the SDR fluctuates depending on daily exchange rate which can be found in the Wall Street Journal and on the internet at http://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_sdrv.aspx. The term “Shipping Incident” is defined in EU Regulation 392/2009 as follows: “Shipping Incident” for the purposes of this regulation include: shipwreck, capsizing, collision or stranding of the ship, explosion or fire in the ship or defect in the ship.</p>
<p>On voyages which do not embark, disembark or call at any United States port and do not embark or disembark at any European Union Member state port or are otherwise encompassed by the two preceding paragraphs, the Carrier shall be entitled to the benefit of any and all restrictions, exemptions, immunities, and limitations of liability set forth in the “Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea of 1974”, as well as the “Protocol to the Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea of 1976” (“Athens Convention”) which limits Carrier’s liability for death or personal injury of a passenger to no more than 46,666 Special Drawing Rights (“SDR”) and limits the Carrier’s liability for a passenger’s luggage or other property to 833 SDR per passenger.
