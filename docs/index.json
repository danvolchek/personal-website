SDV has an incredibly active modding scene with incredible tooling - I jumped right in!\nModding # Over the course of 5 years (May 2017 to October 2022) I created 29 different mods for SDV based on things I wanted to see in the game.\nSome fun stats:\nAs of April 2023, my mods have been downloaded 4.1 million times. At the peak of my work, my mods were within the top 25 of all time (and one still is!) and I was the 3rd most prolific C# mod developer. Similar functionality that 3 of my mods provided was added to the base game. A few favorite mods:\nBetter Artisan Good Icons displays a different/sprite icon for goods made from other goods, e.g. to distinguish apple jelly from rhubarb jelly. It makes seeing which items you have in your inventory way easier. Mod Update Menu displays a list of installed mods, whether any have updates, and where to get the updates from in game. It makes managing modded installs easier. Range Display displays the range of sprinklers (so you know which crops will be watered), and other items. This is the very first idea I had - the one that started it all! Pong replaces the entirity of SDV with pong (the classic arcade game) - you can\u0026rsquo;t play SDV anymore with it installed. This was one of my favorite jokes. You can find links to all of them at the top of this page.\nBeyond making mods, I also made a few contributions to SMAPI (the mod loader for SDV) - including log parser improvements and other website changes.\nThis was a ton of work. Adding features, fixing bugs, triaging bug reports, diving through logs, decompiling and figuring out the game code - it was my main hobby at the time. It also was really great.\nDiscord # During my SDV mod era, I was also very active in the SDV discord server modding channels, providing help to other people making mods and asking questions myself.\nEventually, the server admins recognized my contributions, and asked me to join their team. I became the second server admin ever tasked with keeping the modding channels a safe, collaborative, and wholesome place. I also participated in general server moderation. I did this for a few years.\nIt was an incredible joy to see people posting about which mods they were using and how they loved them and to see my mods on their lists.\nI also helped out with Discord bot creation for the server, making large improvements to mod mail management for the admins and adding features like free game announcements for everyone else.\nThe end of an era # Eventually, my interest in the game waned. I started having less time to play. After 5 years I had played everything there was to play in the game. The game also lost a lot of it\u0026rsquo;s magic after I saw the internals of how everything worked - so I stopped playing.\nI also started having less time to develop. 29 mods was a lot of mods to keep updated and working across continual game + mod loader updates - so I stopped maintaining them.\nAfter many significant updates, about a third of my mods stopped working - but community members provided unofficial updates to keep them compatible. With another massive update on the horizon (1.6), it\u0026rsquo;s not clear how much longer they\u0026rsquo;ll keep working.\nI also started having less time to moderate, and was less and less active on the discord server - so I hung up my hat green paint and went back to being orange.\nOverall, it was an incredible 5 years. I had a lot of fun learning, writing a lot of code, and making friends in the community.\n","date":"October 28, 2022","permalink":"/projects/stardew-valley-mods/","section":"Projects","summary":"I created 29 mods for Stadew Valley, a farm RPG.","title":"Stardew Valley Mods"},{"content":"","date":"January 25, 2022","permalink":"/blog/","section":"Blogs","summary":"","title":"Blogs"},{"content":"This page is a placeholder!\n","date":"January 25, 2022","permalink":"/blog/placeholder/","section":"Blogs","summary":"A placeholder!
