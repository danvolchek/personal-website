  shortdescription: Modifications for the farming simulator video game
  longdescription: |
    [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) is a roleplaying video game where you
    play as a new farmer starting your first farm. You get to grow crops, raise animals, and build relationships with townsfolk.

    I love the game. As I played, I had a lot of ideas that would make it even better. Over the course of a few years,
    I created (and maintained, through multiple major game updates) a variety of unofficial modifications for the game.

    Below is a list of all the modifications I've made, with personal favorites shown first. Most of them are to
    improve the game, but some are just for fun.

    My mods have been downloaded a total of <span class="emphasis" data-content="stardew-total">xxx million</span> times!

    I wrote the code for the page you're reading now. It's built using a simple, custom static website generator.

    The system allows me to edit YAML files to display new projects (or Stardew Valley mods) and even
    automatically updates the Stardew Valley mod usage statistics.

    Beyond the static website generator, it uses plain HTML, CSS, and JS. The end result is a ~26KB (+ one ~356KB image)

  shortdescription: Games for the retro fantasy console
  longdescription: |
    [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) is a retro fantasy console. In other words, it's a video game
    programming environment that replicates the limited hardware capabilities of old game consoles (cpu, ram, screen resolution, etc).

    It provides a fun challenge: create video games in a constrained environment. Below is a list of the games, or carts, that I've made.

    Carts can be played in your browser!

  shortdescription: Solutions to the holiday programming challenges
  longdescription: |
    [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a holiday themed set of 25 programming challenges that release daily on December each year.

    The quickest completions get shown on a leaderboard each day, and so it's fun to compete to get on the leaderboards.

    I like to create two solutions for each day: a fast solution to get on leaderboards, and then a slower/cleaned up solution.

  shortdescription: An app + hardware to remotely lock/unlock doors
  longdescription: |
    This was a project for a university course on the Internet of Things.
    I created an Android app + 3d-printed hardware mount for my apartment front door that allowed it to be opened remotely.

    I took security into account, ensuring that only pre-approved users would be able to open the door
    (through pre-shared private keys), and that replay attacks would not be possible (through timestamps).

    It was fun and a great introduction to hardware (3d printing, Arduino), but ultimately ended up not being very practical.

  shortdescription: A solver for the popular word game Wordle
  longdescription: |
    This is a program that solves [Wordles](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). It chooses the best word at each guess by calculating the word which will reduce
    the number of possible answers the most - i.e. the word with the highest entropy.

    It's a parallel solver - it shards entropy calculation amongst all available logical cores to speed up calculation.

    It usually gets the answer in 3 or 4 guesses.
